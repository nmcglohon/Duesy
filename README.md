A just-for-fun app and web service for managing bill due dates.

For the record - I am not attempting to make an app that would go on the app store or any service that is usable by anyone other than myself. This is mostly a practice project for web-service and app development and integration. Maybe in the future but it's not in the plan.

# Idea

I have general anxiety about bills and accidentally missing due dates. It's never happened to me and I put autopay on everything that I can but I still get this familiar "I missed the final exam!!!" feeling. So I had the idea to make a web service that would integrate with my gmail to determine what bills have been delivered to my inbox. It would parse the email and determine the sender, the due date, and what the bill is about.

I am imagining the interface would be from an iphone app, maybe a web app too. One such that the user could view what due dates they have coming up - could toggle whether an autopay is set up so that it can filter out which ones have yet to be addressed or paid. Notifications for unpaid and non-autopaid bills could be easilly implemented as well.
